# Lecteur-Audio
This is just a simple student project. The goal is to create a very basic Audio Player, as spotify, by using only HTML5/CSS/JS.
If you found this interesting ( it would be a miracle), or need help to understand something, you can send me a mail at simonrousseaud@gmail.com .

P.S : obviously, all the musics and images are royalty-free.
